<h2 align="center">Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace</h2>

Here we have a few copies of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace to be used to compare parsing the text files 
[serially](../parse_serial.py) vs parsing with [multiple processes](../parse.py). Technically, 
I concatenated a few copies of War and Peace together in each text file. Python is slow, but 
not that slow. The full text can be found at the 
[Guttenberg Project](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600).
