# Launch Scripts


Scheduled machines use bash scripts to launch our compute 
jobs. Check out the [ISAAC docs](https://oit.utk.edu/hpsc/isaac-open/writing-job-scripts/)
for details on the various parameters set in these scripts.
If you would like to see what my `~/.bashrc` looks like, 
you can check it out on my [utkdots](https://github.com/yngtodd/utkdots/blob/main/.bashrc).
